Description
===========
Provides dispatching implementations suitable for functional programming
paradigms. The framework provides a mechanism for attaching guards to 
functions similar to Erlang, while also providing the safety of assertions
reminiscent of Eiffel.

Future
======
+ Add default function when nothing else matches
+ Add compatibility layer with S3/S4
